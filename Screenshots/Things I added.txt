The things I added are the following:

	- Added a new piece called Snowman
	- Added unit tests for the pieces
	- Made a simple change to the Render class that makes the chessboard look symmetrical without having to readjust the window size of the output.

The Snowman piece works like this:

	- Its starting position is located where the Queen piece should be.
	- It can move and capture forward, backwards and sideways.
	- If it moves diagonally, it can only move one square at a time.
	- If it moves forward,backwards or sideways, it does so by skipping a square.
	- This means that it can jump over both friendly and enemy pieces.
